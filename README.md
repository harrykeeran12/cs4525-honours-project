# Honours Project

This project aims to use smaller LLMs to correct and find errors in radiology reports.

The dataset used is located [here.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ibrahimhamamci/CT-RATE/tree/main/dataset/radiology_text_reports)



## Development

### Prerequisites:

- A `.env` file that contains a Hugging Face token(`$HF_TOKEN`). You can create this with the commands `touch .env` and `nano .env` to edit the file if you are on a Unix machine or MacOS. 
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) installed on your machine. This will allow you to use the `GGUF` file on your machine.
