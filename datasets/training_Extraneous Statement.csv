Trachea and both main bronchi are open. There is no obstructive pathology in the trachea and both main bronchi. There is an appearance of soft tissue density around the left lung upper lobe bronchus. When evaluated together with the patient's medical history, it was thought that this appearance might belong to a lung mass. It may also cause a similar appearance in a central consolidation. This distinction was not made in this study. In the previous examination of the patient, it was understood that the left lung was almost completely atelectatic except for a small area in the lower lobe. In this percentage, it is understood that the ventilated parts of the left lung have increased. Bilateral pleural effusion is observed, more prominently on the right. There is minimal pleural thickening adjacent to the pleural effusion on the left. However, it is understood that the pleural effusion on the right has just appeared. There are consolidated lung segments in the ventilated left lung, especially in the anterior segment of the upper lobe and in the anteromediobasal segment of the lower lobe. The described appearances were evaluated primarily in favor of atelectasis. Widespread ground glass areas and centriacinar nodules are observed in both lungs, more prominently on the right. There are also nodular consolidations in the left lung. The views described are nonspecific. Many infective pathologies can cause similar appearance.

Nodule?
Technique:
Sections were taken in the axial plan without administering IVKM material and reconstruction was performed at the workstation.
