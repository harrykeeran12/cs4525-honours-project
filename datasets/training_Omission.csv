Trachea, lumen of both main bronchi are open. No obstructive pathology was detected in the lumen of the trachea and both main bronchi. Mediastinal structures were evaluated as suboptimal since the examination was unenhanced. As far as can be observed, no mediastinal and bilateral hilar pathological lymph nodes were detected. Calibration of thoracic main vascular structures is natural. Heart contour and size are natural. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant pathological wall thickening was detected in the examination borders. When both lung parenchyma windows are evaluated; Several parenchymal nodular lesions were observed in the left lung parenchyma, the largest of which was located subpleural in the left lung lower lobe, 4.7 mm in diameter and 6.1 mm in diameter in the lower lobe mediobasal segment on the right, in different localizations in the lung parenchyma. In addition, 7.1 mm diameter parenchymal nodule with irregular borders in the peripheral subpleural area in the lower lobe of the left lung and ground glass density increases around it are noteworthy. Evaluation and follow-up with previous examinations, if any, is recommended. Bilateral peribronchial thickenings are observed. Bilateral pleural thickening-effusion was not detected. Upper abdominal sections in the study area showed a diffuse decrease in liver parenchyma density consistent with adiposity (cholecystectomized).

Technique:
The examination was carried out without contrast at a slice thickness of 1.5 mm.
 Findings:
CTO is within the normal range. Calibration of the main mediastinal vascular structures is natural. No lymph node was detected in the mediastinum in pathological size and configuration. Millimeter-sized lymph nodes are observed, the largest of which is measured in the aorticopulmonary window and measures approximately 8x4 mm. No pathological size and configuration lymph nodes were detected at both hilar levels. Thoracic esophageal calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. The calibration of the trachea and main bronchi is normal and their lumens are clear. Paraseptal-centrilobular emphysema appearances are observed in both lungs at the apical level and in the paramediastinal areas. At the apical level, pleuroparenchymal sequelae changes are observed on both sides. In the middle lobe of the right lung, a branch with bud appearance compatible with diffuse infiltration in the basal segments of both lungs is observed. Sequelae changes are observed in the right lung lower lobe mediobasal and laterobasal segments. Pleuroparenchymal sequelae changes are observed in the laterobasal segment of the left lung. Degenerative changes are observed in the bone structure.
