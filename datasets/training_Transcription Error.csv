Operated sigmoid Ca.
Technique:
Sections were taken without contrast medium and reconstruction was performed at the workstation.
 Findings:
The patient's examination was evaluated together with the examinations after 2017. When the previous examinations of the patient are examined, a surgical defect is observed in the right hemithorax and posterior 8th rib. In the previous examinations of the patient, it was understood that there was a metastatic mass in this localization and it was learned that it was excised. In this examination, a soft tissue mass measuring approximately 20x30 mm was observed in the subcutaneous adipose tissue in this localization. In the previous examination of the patient, a sequela change in this localization and a small lesion that could not be clearly differentiated from a residual-recurrent mass were observed. Since the lesion described in this examination was found to be enlarged, this appearance was thought to be primarily a residual-recurrent mass. Trachea and both main bronchi are open. No occlusive pathology was detected in the trachea and both main bronchi. Consolidation was observed in the superior segment-posterobasal segment of the lower lobe of the right lung. When evaluated together with the patient's previous examinations, no significant difference was detected in the described appearance for a long time. It has been understood that the described appearance is a sequelae change due to treatments. Apart from this, there are occasional atelectasis in both lungs. Minimal emphysematous changes were observed in both lungs. There are nodules measuring 5 mm and 3 mm in diameter in the right lung lower lobe superior segment and right lung lower lobe anterobasal segment. It has been found that the described nodules have just appeared. These nodules were thought to be metastases.

Operated sigmoid Ca. Technique:
Sections were taken without contrast medium and reconstruction was performed at the workstation. Findings:
The patient's examination was evaluated together with the examinations after 2017. When the pervious examinations of the patient are examined, a surgical defect is observed in the right hemithorax and posterior 8th rib. In the previous examinations of the patient, it was understood that there was a metastatic mass in this localization and it was learned that it was excised. In this examination, a soft tissue mass measuring approximately 20x30 mm was observed in the subcutaneous adipose tissue in this localization. In the previous examination of the patient, a sequela change in this localization and a small lesion that could not be clearly differentiated from a residual-recurrent mass were observed. Since the lesion described in this examination was found to be enlarged, this appearance was thought to be primarily a residual-recurrent mass. Trachea and both main bronchi are open. No occlusive pathology was detected in the trachea and both main bronchi. Consolidation was observed in the superior segment-posterobasal segment of the lower lobe of the right lung. When evaluated together with the patient's previous examinations, no significant difference was detected in the described appearance for a long time. It has been understood that the described appearance is a sequelae change due to treatments. Apart from this, there are occasional atelectasis in both lungs. Minimal emphysematous changes were observed in both lungs. There are nodules measuring 5 mm and 3 mm in diameter in the right lung lower lobe superior segment and right lung lower lobe anterobasal segment. It has been found that the described nodules have just appeared. These nodules were thought to be metastases.

 Thyroid gland sizes are natural. No lymph node was observed in psychological size and appearance in both supraclavicular fossae. No lymph node was observed in pathological size and appearance in both axillae. Thoracic esophageal calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. There are wall calcifications in the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and thoracic aorta. Right and left main pulmonary artery diameters were measured at the upper limit (secondary to decreased lung parenchymal elasticity). There is a dolicolite course in the thoracic aorta. There is stent material in a short segment proximal to the LAD. Calcified atheroma plaques are observed in the RCA and circumflex. Heart dimensions and compartments appear natural. Right upper paratracheal and bilateral lower paratracheal subaortic localized short axes and nonspecific mediastinal lymph nodes under 1 cm are present. Calcified lymph node is observed in the subcarinal area. Significant diffuse emphysematous changes in bilateral upper lobe apical segments and lower lobe basal segments in both lungs and subpleural parenchymal fibrotic ground glass opacities showing apicobasal gradient in both lungs, interlobular septal thickenings, and honeycomb lung appearance in basal segments are present, which is considered compatible with interstitial fibrosis. In the current examination, consolidation was found in the right lung lower lobe superior and posterobasal laterobasal segments in the honeycomb lung appearance areas. Superposed infection may be considered in a patient with a history of fever and cough. It shows lobar involvement. It is in the form of a consolidation area. The increase in tracheal diameter is secondary to restrictive lung parenchymal disease. In the evaluation of upper abdominal sections entering the image area; A adenoma with a diameter of 3.7 cm is observed in the superior part of the left adrenal gland. Contour lobulation is observed in the upper pole of the right kidney, and the presence of a space-occupying lesion in this area could not be excluded due to the lack of contrast in the examination. Evaluation with USG would be appropriate. A 9 mm diameter cyst was observed in the liver segment 7 localization. Trabecular prominence due to osteoporosis and osteophyte formations leading to bridging were observed in the vertebrae. Impressions: 
In the case with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, no difference was observed in the fibrotic parenchymal involvement pattern in the lung, and consolidation areas with lobar involvement in the lower lobe of the right lung are a new finding. Lobar consolidation is observed. Pneumonia? . Calcified atheromatous plaques in the coronary arteries and stent material proximal to the LAD adenoma .

Sections were taken in the axial plane without contrast material and reconstruction was performed at the workstation. Findings:
Trachea and both main bronchiectasis are open. No occlusive pathology was detected in the trachea and both main bronchi. Consolidation is observed in the upper lobe of the left lung, which covers almost the entire upper lobe. There is also consolidation and ground glass appearance in the lower lobe of the left lung. Ground-glass appearances and centriacinar nodules are observed in the lower lobe of the right lung. Findings are consistent with pneumonic infiltration. No mass was detected in both lungs in this examination. There are localized linear atelectasis and minimal emphysematous changes in both lungs. Mediastinal structures could not be evaluated optimally because no contrast agent was given. As far as can be observed: The heart is larger than normal. There are diffuse atheromatous plaques in the aorta and coronary arteries. Minimal pericardial and pleural effusion was observed. There is a central venous catheter on the right. The catheter terminates in the right atrium. There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and hilar regions. There is no pathological wall thickness increase in the esophagus within the sections. No upper abdominal free fluid-collection was detected in the sections. The left adrenal gland corpus has a thickening of 25 mm at its thickest point. No fractures or lytic-destructive lesions were detected in the bone structures within the sections. Impressions:
