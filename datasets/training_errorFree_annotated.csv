Technique:
1.5 mm thick non-contrast sections were taken in the axial plane with MD CT.
 Findings:
Trachea and main bronchi are open. A few millimetric-sized lymph nodes in the right upper paratracheal area are observed. No pathological LAP was detected in the mediastinum. The heart and mediastinal vascular structures have a natural appearance. Pleural effusion-thickening was not detected in both hemithorax. In the evaluation of both lung parenchyma; The ground-glass density increases observed in the previous examination in both lungs completely disappeared. In addition, an obvious regression is observed in the size of the nodules, which are observed in large numbers in both lungs. The most obvious regression was in the posterobasal segment of the left lung lower lobe. The size of the nodule, which was observed in the previous examination with a diameter of approximately 7x5 mm, was measured as approximately 5.5x3.5 mm. Significant reduction in the size of other nodules is also observed. In sections passing through the upper abdomen, liver parenchyma density decreased in line with hepatosteatosis. Bilateral adrenal glands appear natural. No lytic-destructive lesions were detected in bone structures.

 Findings:
Trachea and both main bronchi are open. No occlusive pathology was detected in the trachea and both main bronchi. No mass or infiltrative lesion was detected in both lungs. Mediastinal structures cannot be evaluated optimally because contrast material is not given. As far as can be observed: Heart contour and size are normal. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion. The widths of the mediastinal main vascular structures are normal. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes were detected in the mediastinum and hilar regions. No pathological wall thickness increase was observed in the esophagus within the sections. No upper abdominal free fluid-collection was detected in the sections. No enlarged lymph nodes in pathological dimensions were detected. In the upper abdominal organs within the sections, there is no mass with distinguishable borders as far as it can be observed within the borders of non-enhanced CT. Thoracic vertebral corpus heights, alignments and densities are normal. Intervertebral disc distances are preserved. The neural foramina are open.
