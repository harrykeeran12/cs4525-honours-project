The patient's examination was evaluated together with the examinations after 2017. When the pervious examinations of the patient are examined, a surgical defect is observed in the right hemithorax and posterior 8th rib. In the previous examinations of the patient, it was understood that there was a metastatic mass in this localization and it was learned that it was excised. In this examination, a soft tissue mass measuring approximately 20x30 mm was observed in the subcutaneous adipose tissue in this localization. In the previous examination of the patient, a sequela change in this localization and a small lesion that could not be clearly differentiated from a residual-recurrent mass were observed. Since the lesion described in this examination was found to be enlarged, this appearance was thought to be primarily a residual-recurrent mass. Trachea and both main bronchi are open. No occlusive pathology was detected in the trachea and both main bronchi. Consolidation was observed in the superior segment-posterobasal segment of the lower lobe of the right lung. When evaluated together with the patient's previous examinations, no significant difference was detected in the described appearance for a long time. It has been understood that the described appearance is a sequelae change due to treatments. Apart from this, there are occasional atelectasis in both lungs. Minimal emphysematous changes were observed in both lungs. There are nodules measuring 5 mm and 3 mm in diameter in the right lung lower lobe superior segment and right lung lower lobe anterobasal segment. It has been found that the described nodules have just appeared. These nodules were thought to be metastases. There was no appearance that could be evaluated in favor of a mass or pneumonic infiltration in both lungs.
