Interlobular septal thickenings are observed in the observed lung parenchyma areas. Consolidation area interlobular septal thickenings, approximately 2.7x2.8 cm in size, extending towards the parenchyma on the lateral aspect of the anterior lobe are selected. Lobulated contoured pleural effusions measuring 5.3 cm in the thickest part are observed around the atelectatic lung tissue in the right hemithorax.

Nodular solid lesions are observed in the upper mediastinum, prevascular, paratracheal, subcarinal and hilar regions, almost all of which have calcifications in the central part and are evaluated in favor of lymphadenopathies. Although the sizes of some of the described lesions cannot be distinguished from each other, the largest is observed in the paratracheal region and its short diameter is 15 mm. There is no pathological wall thickness increase in the esophagus within the sections. Trachea and both main bronchi are normal. No occlusive pathology was detected in the trachea and both main bronchi. Luminal narrowings are observed in the distal sections of both main bronchi and lobar bronchi, and it is thought that this may be due to the compression of lymphadenopathies in the hilar region. Almost all of the right lung middle lobe is atelectatic. There is subsegmental atelectasis in the lingular segment of the left lung upper lobe. Apart from these, there are sometimes linear atelectasis in the lower lobes of both lungs. There is a mosaic attenuation pattern in both lungs (small airway disease?, small vessel disease?).

Nodular solid lesions are observed in the upper mediastinum, prevascular, paratracheal, subcarinal and hilar regions, almost all of which have calcifications in the central part and are evaluated in favor of lymphadenopathies.

No occlusive pathology was detected in the trachea and both main bronchi. Luminal narrowings are observed in the distal sections of both main bronchi and lobar bronchi, and it is thought that this may be due to the compression of lymphadenopathies in the hilar region.

Apart from these, there are sometimes linear atelectasis in the lower lobes of both lungs. There is a mosaic attenuation pattern in both lungs (small airway disease?, small vessel disease?). There are nodular lesions with calcifications in the central parts of both lungs.
