Technique:
1.5 mm thick non-contrast sections were taken in the axial plane.
 Findings:
Mediastinal structures were evaluated as suboptimal since the examination was unenhanced. As far as can be seen; Trachea and lumen of both main bronchi are open. No occlusive pathology was detected in the trachea and lumen of both main bronchi. Calibration of thoracic main vascular structures is natural. Heart contour size is natural. Pericardial thickening-effusion was not detected. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant pathological wall thickening was detected. No lymph node was detected in mediastinal and bilateral hilar pathological size and appearance. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Nodular ground glass density increases were observed in the peribronchovascular and peripheral subpleural areas in the lower lobe of the right lung. The outlook can be traced in Covid-19 pneumonia. However, it is not specific. Clinical and laboratory correlation is recommended. Upper abdominal sections entering the examination area are natural. Bilateral adrenal gland calibration was normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. No lytic-destructive lesion was detected in bone structures.
