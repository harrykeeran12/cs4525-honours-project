Ingested oral contrast can be seen pooling in dependent portion of gastric tube, approximately 13 cm distal to a (the) site of primary anastomosis.
Slight contrast filled mural irregularity (see saved key image) on the gastric tube aspect of the side-to-side (side-to-end) anastomosis between proximal oesophagus and gastric tube, with no evidence of extraluminal contrast leak.
No extra luminal contrast leak appreciated on this examination within limitation of dependent (posterior) positioning of oral contrast, and the anterior positioning of the longitudinal staple line of gastric tube.
Oral contrast seen beneath the level of diaphragm.

3.6 x 1.1 cm (see saved key image) locule of gas with further small volume of fluid seen in posterior superior mediastinum, just medial to the oesophageal side to side anastomosis, with no associated contrast leak, likely reflecting residual postoperative changes.

Left-sided moderate sized pleural effusion with small residual locule dated pleural effusion in the right oblique fissure.  Right-sided chest drain in situ.  Small right apical pneumothorax.
Atelectasis in lower lobes, middle lobe, and right upper lobe.  Severe emphysema in predominantly right chest wall, and paraspinal soft tissue, likely relating to recent (surgery.)
