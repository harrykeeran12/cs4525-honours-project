Findings:
No relevant previous examination available for comparison.

Degenerative disc disease is seen at multiple levels.
T11/T12 posterior intervertebral disc protrusion into central canal zone, indenting the thecal sac and causing mild displacement of the cord posteriorly, though preserved CSF rim can be seen a around it.  Mild ligamentum flavum hypertrophy at this level.  Wide patent neural foramina.
Further mild tissue disc protrusion at the T10/T11 level with preserved CSF rim.  Wide patent neural foramina.
Diffuse disc bulging L2/L3 with otherwise patent spinal and neural foramina.
Well defined due to high signal lesions in T12, L4, and S1 vertebral body are likely to represent distended granulomas

Findings
Lung parenchyma: Normal
Pleura: Normal
Major airways: Normal
Lymph nodes: Normal
Pulmonary vessels: Normal
Heart, pericardium, mediastinum: Normal

Chest wall and breast: normal
Supraclavicular, axillary and subpectoral lymph nodes: normal
 
Liver: Normal
Biliary tract: Gallstones of the gallbladder.
Pancreas: Normal
Spleen: Normal
Adrenal glands: Normal

Kidneys: Reduced corticomedullary differentiation

Small bowel: Normal
Appendix: Normal
Large bowel: Normal

Peritoneum: No free fluid. No pneumoperitoneum. No drainable collection.
Omentum/mesentery: Normal
Lymph nodes: Normal

Vessels: Calcific atheromatous change of aorta. Severe superior mesenteric artery stenosis. Diffuse concentric mural thickening of the aorta and major upper limb arteries. This appears more than could be explained by atherosclerosis alone.
Pelvic viscera: Normal
Perineum: Normal
Abdominal wall/hernia: Normal

Musculoskeletal: Mild degenerative change in the spine

Conclusion:
No definite source of sepsis. No acute surgical pathology. No collection. No intra-abdominal abnormality. (Gallstones. Reduced renal corticomedullary differentiation compatible with renal failure.)
Diffuse concentric mural thickening of the aorta and major upper limb arteries. This appears more than could be explained by atherosclerosis alone. This raises the possibility of a major vessel vasculitis.","CT Thorax, abdomen and pelvis
