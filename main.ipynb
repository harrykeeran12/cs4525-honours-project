Degenerative changes in thoracolumbar spine and sacroiliac joints.\n.\nConclusion:\nExpanding pelvic haematoma with active haemorrhage at time of examination.

         "1. Incorrect Words: \"active haemorrhage at time of examination\"\n   Problem: The phrase \"at time of examination\" is redundant because the examination is being performed at the time in question. A more accurate statement would be \"Expanding pelvic haematoma with active hemorrhage.\"\n\n2. Incorrect Words: \"Likely from distal right ovarian artery.\"\n   Problem: The patient's total hysterectomy includes the removal of both ovaries, so there is no right ovarian artery in this case. A more accurate statement would be \"Likely from the distal left ovarian artery remnant.\" (Assuming that the left ovarian artery was not removed during hysterectomy and is the source of bleeding.)\n\n3. Transcription Error: \"Pneumobilia\"\n   Problem: The correct term is cholangiopneumoperitoneum, which refers to air in the biliary tree and peritoneal cavity. This error may not significantly impact the interpretation but can be confusing for those unfamiliar with this term.\n\n4. Internal Inconsistency: \"No other site of contrast extravasation identified\" and \"Active contrast extravasation into haematoma from distal left ovarian artery as described.\"\n   Problem: The statement \"No other site of contrast extravasation identified\" contradicts the subsequent finding of active contrast extravasation from the distal left ovarian artery. A more accurate report would clarify that there is active contrast extravasation only at the distal left ovarian artery remnant and no other sites were identified.\n\n5. Insertion Statement: \"Comparison is made with previous examination.\"\n   Problem: This statement does not provide any additional information or impact the interpretation of the current examination. It can be removed without affecting the report's clarity.",
         "**Radiology Report Analysis and Corrections**\n\n**Clinical Information Provided:**\n\n- **Mistake:** \"?  active haemorrhage\"\n  - **Problem:** The question mark indicates uncertainty, which is not appropriate in a clinical report. It should be stated clearly whether there is active haemorrhage or not.\n  - **Correction:** \"Active haemorrhage is present.\"\n\n**Technique:**\n\n- **Mistake:** \"unenhanced, arterial, and venous.\"\n  - **Problem:** The sequence of the CT angiogram description is correct, but it's important to ensure that the description matches the actual scan protocol. If there was a different sequence or if any part was missed, this should be noted.\n  - **Correction:** \"Unenhanced, arterial phase, and venous phase.\"\n\n**Findings:**\n\n- **Mistake:** \"Comparison is made with previous examination.\"\n  - **Problem:** This statement is correct but lacks specificity about what was compared. It should be more detailed to provide clinical context.\n  - **Correction:** \"Comparison with a previous CT mesenteric angiogram reveals interval development of an expanding pelvic haematoma.\"\n\n**Vascular:**\n\n- **Mistake:** \"No haematoma with active contrast extravasation from distal left ovarian artery.\"\n  - **Problem:** The statement is contradictory. It mentions no haematoma while also describing active contrast extravasation, which implies the presence of a haematoma.\n  - **Correction:** \"Active contrast extravasation is identified from the distal left ovarian artery, suggestive of a haematoma.\"\n\n**Extravascular:**\n\n- **Mistake:** \"Scattered pockets of moderate density fluid in the subphrenic spaces and intraperitoneally in keeping with haemoperitoneum.\"\n  - **Problem:** The description is correct but could be more specific about the nature of the fluid or any associated pathology.\n  - **Correction:** \"Scattered pockets of moderate density fluid in the subphrenic spaces and intraperitoneally are consistent with haemoperitoneum, possibly due to the active haemorrhage.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Mistake:** \"Expanding pelvic haematoma with active haemorrhage at time of examination. Likely from distal right ovarian artery.\"\n  - **Problem:** The conclusion incorrectly states the source of the haemorrhage as the \"distal right ovarian artery,\" while the findings describe extravasation from the \"distal left ovarian artery.\"\n  - **Correction:** \"Expanding pelvic haematoma with active haemorrhage at time of examination. Likely from the distal left ovarian artery.\"\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe radiology report contains several errors, primarily in consistency and accuracy of findings description and conclusion. It's crucial to ensure that all statements align with the actual imaging findings and clinical context. The corrected report should clearly state the presence of active haemorrhage, specify the source from the correct ovarian artery, and accurately describe the haematoma and associated findings.",
